## Key features
This starter template has the following advantages, among others:
* It demonstrates the basic features of this framework and supports hot module reloading.
* The extensions to Hof.js required for HMR support are implemented in hmr.js. This file is imported into index.js.
* All js files in the project are automatically bundled. The resulting file can be imported as bundle.js. This is done in index.html.

## Documentation

Due to the early stage of development of this starter, no documentation exists yet. However, since it is very much based on JavaScript and web standards and allows intuitive development, the above explanations are usually sufficient to use all features.
